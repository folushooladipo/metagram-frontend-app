## Note
The Angular CLI will not replace `process.env.<SOME_VALUE>` references in my code with their actual values. So, the environment file(s) that will be in this directory will be generated by `../generate-environment-files.ts`. as part of the app's build and startup process.

Since I can now inject values into the environment files at will, I have decided to have only one file which will be `./environment.ts`.
