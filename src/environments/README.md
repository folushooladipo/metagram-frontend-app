## Note
The Angular CLI will not replace `process.env.<SOME_VALUE>` references in my code with their actual values. So, the environment files that will be in this directory will be generated by `../generate-environment-files.ts`. as part of the app's build and startup process. The names of the files will be:
- environment.ts: for local/dev environments.
- environment.prod.ts: for production environments.
